Medicine Recommendation System using AI
Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent medicine recommendation system using artificial intelligence techniques. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze patient symptoms and medical history in order to recommend appropriate medications or treatments.

Features
Symptom Analysis: The system collects and analyzes patient symptoms through user input or medical records.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizes various machine learning models such as decision trees, neural networks, or ensemble methods to predict suitable medications.
Personalized Recommendations: Recommendations are personalized based on individual patient profiles and medical history.
Data Security: Ensures patient data privacy and security through encryption and access control mechanisms.
User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals or patients to interact with the system.
